# Abstract App Module CronCat

The Abstract App Module CronCat is a starting point for developing composable smart-contracts, or "apps", that enable features or transform Accounts into standalone products. Each app is instantiated for each Account individually and is migratable. Apps are allowed to perform actions on the proxy contract and may also want to integrate with other enabled modules and APIs, and have access to the AnsHost contract for address storage.

The base state of an app includes the following:

- Proxy address
- Manager address
- AnsHost address (configurable)

The proxy and manager addresses are not configurable after instantiation.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following command:

```shell
chmod +x ./template-setup.sh
./template-setup.sh
```

This will set up the template.

## Using the Justfile

This repository comes with a `justfile`, which is a handy task runner that helps with building, testing, and deploying your Abstract app module.

### Installing Just

To use the `justfile`, you need to install `just` first. Please follow the instructions in the [official Just repository on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just) to install it for your operating system.

### Available Tasks

Here are some of the tasks available in the `justfile`:

- `build`: Build everything with all features.
- `test`: Run all tests.
- `format`: Format the codebase.
- `lint`: Lint the codebase.
- `lintfix`: Fix linting errors automatically.
- `refresh`: Clean and update the project.
- `watch`: Watch the codebase and run `lcheck` on changes.
- `check`: Check the codebase for issues.
- `wasm`: Build all contracts in the repository for the specified chain.
- `deploy`: Deploy all the APIs to the specified network.
- `wasm-contract`: Build the specified module for the specified chain.
- `deploy-contract`: Deploy the specified module to the specified network.

You can see the full list of tasks available by running `just --list`.

To run a task, simply type `just <task-name>`. For example, to run the tests, you can type `just test`.
